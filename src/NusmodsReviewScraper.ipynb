The lack of proofs was somewhat disappointing. The workload was quite high due to the many problemsets and the infuriating grader platform. I spent more time on this module than CS2100 and CS2106, but less time compared to CS2030S.\\n\\nTopics:\\nOrders of growth, sorting, balanced binary search trees, various other trees, hash tables, simple amortized analysis, graph searching algorithms, shortest path algorithms, topological sorts, minimum spanning trees, heaps, union find data structure, dynamic programming.\\n\\nContent:\\nWhile there may seem like a lot of content, much of it is intuitive and can be derived from a few core definitions and invariants. Having a solid grounding in discrete math, especially proofs and combinatorics, helps.\\n\\nI was a bit disappointed at the lack of (rigorous) proofs for many of the claims taught, especially those involving randomization or probability.\\n\\nProfessors:\\nProf Seth is an enthusiastic teacher and I love his teaching.\\n\\nWorkload:\\n- a 1-hour and a 2-hour lecture per week. Negligible EXP given as EXP.\\n- a 2-hour tutorial every week. Level of participation is counted as EXP.\\n- a 1-hour recitation every week. Negligible EXP given.\\n- a quiz after every lecture. EXP is awarded.\\n- a problemset after every 1-2 lectures. EXP is awarded.\\n- some optional coding practices to farm EXP if you need more.\\n- a 2-hour midterm\\n- a 2-hour final\\n\\nSome percentage of our grades goes to a gamified learning system on Coursemology where we have to gain EXP to level up.

Later questions on graph search algorithms and dynamic programming were also heavy, with walls of text and notation to choose between, making it difficult to do the paper quickly (and time was a concern). \\n\\nRecitations: \\nThe introductory lecture said that attendance would be graded but I did not see my tutor taking attendance, neither did I see XP awarded on coursemology. That being said, Eldric is amazing at teaching (you know it when people are willing to sit on the floor to attend his class) and explaining big ideas, and is certainly very enthusiastic. And unsurprisingly, ideas of how to approach recitation questions were tested in finals, so attending them is useful (and the problems I personally found very interesting).\\n\\n\\u003cu>Overall thoughts:\\u003c/u>\\nThis is an important and useful module. Programming skill isn\\u2019t really tested, neither is speed/accuracy of creating algorithms, instead focusing heavily on efficiency of the algorithms and proof that they work. I suppose there could be more rigour on the practical aspects of implementing algorithms and even data structures (such as sorting algorithms, graph search, or heaps/priority queues, or even hash functions), but already the content and time spent on understanding was somewhat heavy. \\n\\nExpected Grade: B+\",\"isAtFlagLimit\":false,\"isHighlighted\":false,\"canVote\":false,\"forum\":\"nusmods-prod\",\"depth\":0,\"points\":0,\"moderationLabels\":[],\"isEdited\":false,\"sb\":false},{\"editableUntil\":\"2024-05-12T09:56:09\",\"dislikes\":0,\"thread\":\"7513374218\",\"numReports\":0,\"likes\":0,\"message\":\"\\u003cp>Taken in AY 22/23 Semester 2\\u003cbr>Lecturers: Prof Seth Gilbert, Prof Arnab Bhattacharya\\u003c/p>\\u003cp>Content:\\u003cbr>- First half: Java OOP crash course, ADTs (lists, stacks, priority queues), basic algorithm analysis (time &amp; space complexity), searching, sorting, search trees (AVL trees, BSTs, Trie).

I think it would have been much more helpful to link to the actual implementation of different algorithms. There were some hiccups with the uploading of lecture recordings after recess week. As a result, I stopped watching the lecture recordings and mainly relied on the lecture slides, textbook, and tutorials to keep up with the course content.\\n\\nIf you do want to watch lectures, you can view past year recordings on YouTube, or check out \\u003ca href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/@abdul_bari\\\">Abdul Bari's\\u003c/a> Channel.\\n\\n\\u003cu>Tutorials\\u003c/u>\\nHalfway through the semester, I gave up on trying to finish the tutorials as they were too difficult for me and I did not have enough time to work on them. The approach I would recommend is to spend maybe half an hour before the lesson skimming through the tutorial questions to get an idea of what will be discussed in class, and paying attention when your TA is going through the questions.\\n\\nI found the tutorials to be extremely helpful in demystifying the concepts in the lecture notes (probably because I had a very good TA). My tutorial sessions almost always took up the entire 2-hour slot, so schedule your lessons accordingly.\\n\\n\\u003cu>Recitations\\u003c/u>\\nSimilar to tutorials, you should aim to briefly read through the recitation questions beforehand.

CS2040S is actually meant for CS students, but as long as there is a slot, you can still bid for one even though you are not a CS student, thus I ended up here :). Unlike the other version of CS2040, CS2040S requires one additional prerequisite, which is CS1231/MA1100 since students here are expected to be able to do some simple proofs that are being taught. Therefore, expect (a lot) faster pace compared to CS2040 and CS2040C. We finished the content of regular CS2040 by week 11 and did some special non-examinable topics afterwards. Some people may also read my CS1231 module review and wondering why I am able to take CS1231 and CS2040S concurrently. I filed an appeal to the department since I urgently need CS2040 equivalent this semester to unlock the higher level modules, and the other CS2040 equivalents clash with my other mods.\n",

The number of compulsory problems from each problem sets range from 3-5 per sets. However, there are many optional problems for practices. The optional problems are crazy and it takes a lot of time to finish, so if you still care about your sanity, please don't attempt it lol since they may use other concepts outside CS2040S scopes and you may ended up reading research papers. The 3 quizzes test us on the understanding of the concepts by devising the most \"efficient\" algorithms to tackle some problems. The final is the nightmare among them. It is a 44 MCQs paper but actually the style of the question is similar to the quizzes, but the format is modified as MCQs. It is very annoying in my opinion since the problem is mostly like \"What is the most efficient algorithms that you can think of to solve blablabla?\" and there are some Big-Oh listed as the choices.\n",

      "                  Holy moly, what a module. Really put me in my place tbh. I have prior experience in programming, which led me to be ambitious and aim for an A, or even an A+, in this module. Problem sets were for the most part alright especially given my prior experience, but the concepts are genuinely deceiving. You'd think you understand it, but then you attempt a past year's paper and have no idea what's going on. For my intake, they didn't really test any algorithm skills in the sense of actually writing a program. I guess because cohort size was large, both midterms and finals were entirely MCQ, which means the concepts tested are mostly theory which I'm quite bad at, as it turns out.\n",

Oh well, guess I'll try harder next semester. As for how to study for this module, probably don't use my advice because I studied really hard and understood the concepts very well, but I'm afraid the results may not reflect that, which means there was probably something wrong with the way I attempted the questions / the way I studied.\n",

This is an important course, probably the most important, as it covers important concepts that will be tested time and time again in your job interviews. If you have the chance to take this under Seth Gilbert, I highly encourage you to do so. I enjoyed my time thoroughly under him. If you are already comfortable with Data Structures and Algorithms, this course should be a breeze for you. You could take the trinity (CS2030S, CS2040S, CS2100) without much trouble in my opinion if CS2040S is completely fine for you.\n",

I did every single optional practice, attempted every contest and did every problem set diligently. I prepared for every tutorial class, and prepared for every recitation and some point. This summed up to be an average of about 10 hours per week. In retrospect, I wouldn't have spent this much time. There is no need to prepare for recitations, and tutorials can kind of be skimmed through and \"as long as you get the idea, it's fine\".  This can be way lower if you skip the (time-consuming) optional practices as well. Perhaps, if I could redo this course, the workload would look more like ~6.5 hours / week.\n",

The tutors will make use of the problem sets to reinforce and extend the various concepts taught in lectures, after which there will be a hands-on session during which the students are tasked with a selected programming problem to practise the relevant concepts. Prof Halim dislikes asking his students to re-invent the wheels, so the main focus of the practical components in this course is to analyse the problems correctly and choose the best design using the ideal data structures, rather than to remember how each data structure or algorithm is implemented.\n",

If I had to compare with CS2030S and CS2100, I'd say that content wise, CS2100 has the most content, followed by CS2030S and then CS2040S. If we're talking about workload, then CS2030S would be highest, followed by CS2100, and then CS2040S. Difficulty wise will vary, but generally people seem to find CS2040S harder than CS2030S, with CS2100 being relatively easy compared to these 2 modules. So looking at it this way, I would say that this mod is not very high workload, and content wise only covers basic concepts in the various topics.\n",

I personally think this creates a weak foundation, but for an intro mod, I suppose they're trying to fit as much breadth as possible. Nonetheless, Prof Seth is a great lecturer. I highly recommend taking it under him.\n",

I can see why people would say this module is high workload, especially if you try to finish ALL your tutorial questions. I tend to give them a try and just leave it if I can't solve them after awhile, and it worked out for me. This approach made the mod experience much more enjoyable and enriching for me, since I'm just focused on learning rather than clearing the work.\n",

      "                  The REAL workload comes from tutorial and recitation questions. Tutorial questions are super hard; you spend a long time trying to solve it before tutorial, and if you get a sucky TA, you spend an even longer time trying to digest it after tutorials. Recitations introduce whole new data structures sometimes, and for a 1 hour lesson, the number of questions and concepts is frankly insane. My TA is always rushing through and can never quite finish. Needless to say, I spend another huge amount of time digesting it after recitations. Now for problem sets. There are easier ones and extremely hard ones that I spend sometimes 2 days doing (because I do them on my own with basically no help; but you can always ask your friends for the strategy). I spent basically the whole reading week just to review the tutorial and recitation questions.\n",

      "                  The biggest problem I had from this module is that you can learn the concepts well and do practice and go through every single tutorial and recitation question, but still be stumped by the exam. It's because there are always questions that require you to be big brain and think out of the box, almost like you need creativity in a sense. It's not just a matter of applying concepts you have learned. And as such, the amount of work you do doesn't always correlate with your grade since those tricky questions you see in your practice will never come out again. Yet, it is important to go through the incredibly heavy amount of work and overwhelming content properly because exposure to such questions early will help you with revision for interviews.\n",

It was pain and suffering to go through it, but just struggle through it and you will definitely not regret trying your best!\n",

He explains ideas well and is enthusiastic, and attending his lectures was enjoyable. The second half was taught by Prof Arnab, who just wasn’t good at explaining ideas and would often have me confused when he tried to derive or prove something. I resorted to watching past year recorded lectures instead, where the whole sem was taught by Prof Seth. I felt that the first half of the content, up to trees, was reasonably easy to understand, and I suppose that was reflected in the midterms. Hashing was where the content started getting difficult (especially with how it was tested in finals), and graphs and graph searching algorithms were also not particularly easy to prove although it wasn’t difficult to obtain a high-level understanding (that was later more solidified by doing the problem sets). Dynamic programming seemed a bit rushed, although if one has prior knowledge on the topic then it wasn’t too difficult.\n",

      "                  Problem sets: These are programming tasks. You don’t need a particularly great understanding of Java to do this, or even how the IDE works. The IDE already does help you a lot, as do the test files and the IDE itself, so details about how Java works and the syntax are a non-issue. The difficulty is more of designing algorithms that work and provide results in reasonable time-complexities, but even that, isn’t particularly difficult the way some labs in CS2030S are. Most problem sets are 1000-3000XP (if you get full marks) and the deadline is typically 6-7 days after they’re released. They do allow you to get a good grasp of how an algorithm works, and how to implement it, though, so they are helpful for learning. Expect to take anywhere from 2 to 10h on a problem set, depending on which one you’re doing and how much debugging you have to do. The problem sets being on Coursemology does mean there are both public and private test cases, and one thing that myself and peers did get stuck on at times was figuring out why our solution was not passing private test cases, though that was typically to do with edge cases, but my TA in particular was helpful with debugging and suggestions to pass private cases.\n",

      "                  There are also lecture reviews (MCQ quizzes on lecture content) that have to be done within 24h of the lecture for the full marks (250XP each) and are not too difficult.\n",

      "                  Tutorial attendance &amp; participation also count towards the Coursemology grade, with about 400-600 XP per session, the exact amount awarded depends on TA. Not a lot to say, my TA gave those who did tutorial questions beforehand and shared their answers more than those who did not. Tutorial questions are hard and certainly interesting, but there were multiple times where I simply had no idea where to start. Sometimes though, they could be better set, as evidenced when the answer sheet had to void the question.\n",

Format was also similar to past years, except that an ambiguous sorting question ended up requiring multiple combinations of answers to be accepted. Additionally, the last question did seem a bit ridiculous with &gt;20 MCQ options, but the weightage wasn’t too large.\n",

      "                  This was quite difficult. Already in the past year papers, it was notable that 2023’s paper was more difficult than years before, and this year’s was even more difficult than previous years. I expected to get &lt;50/100 for finals after walking out, and most of my peers felt the same too. There was 19 marks of ‘trivia’ which was a little annoying, but by far what most disliked was that there were 22 marks of ‘stats’ questions, which were to do with expectation and probability in hashing, involving some derivation/proof and knowledge of permutations and combinations. I personally found it somewhat doable, but not quite what was taught (well). That being said, throughout most of the paper, I felt that I was making a lot of guesses that I didn’t have confidence in, and so did most of my peers. Later questions on graph search algorithms and dynamic programming were also heavy, with walls of text and notation to choose between, making it difficult to do the paper quickly (and time was a concern).\n",

And unsurprisingly, ideas of how to approach recitation questions were tested in finals, so attending them is useful (and the problems I personally found very interesting).\n",

      "                  Normal CS workload I would say. Definitely lower than CS2030S and CS2100. The content is very surface level, one can get away with just knowing how the data structure and algo works and it would be enough to get a good grade for the mod. People who took CS1010X have a decent advantage when it comes to workload as there are many overlaps between CS2040S such as hashing, dynamic programming, time complexity, union find, sorting to name a few. Although CS1010X is less in depth it really eases the workload as its more of building on concepts one already knows. Most of the workload comes from the PS but the issue is that the PS is literally on github so IYKYK.\n",

      "                  4. One room for improvement is definitely coursemology, to say that its bad is an understatement. For example being able to know why the code fails is something so simple to implement I am surprised its still not. Also being able to compared your output to coursemology's output is also something that is not hard to do so I wonder why it's not available.\n",
      "                  <br/>\n",
      "                  5. Lastly would be the heavy use of pseudocode. I am not kidding when I say that one is able to get a good grade WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO CODE IN JAVA. For example, how many students can actually implement quicksort after taking CS2040s, probably less than 50. How many students can implement weighted union find or implement dijkstra algorithm probably even lesser. I understand that CS is theoretical but still it is indeed quite concerning for students to get an A for this mod without even knowing how to code. Perhaps a PE or something makes more sense.\n",

These were not too trivial, as the average student may have only touched Java as the course started. It also required a good understanding of the theory at first, as coding without having a plan is often not a good idea. Instead of toy problems seen perhaps in a number of other classes, the problem sets were part of a larger useful application, such as decoding images or word autocomplete - you had to implement the key procedures to make the application work. Certainly they won't be what you would do on LeetCode, but it makes learning a fair bit more exciting. There were a number of optional problem sets, but I was too lazy to do them. Somehow, there were no problem sets or examinations questions on dynamic programming, however important it may be.\n",

I heard that even some TAs were unable to explain the hardest questions. Recitations were even harder than that, and talked about interesting theoretical problems as well - for my session there was basically one person who dominated the entire discussion. I could have learnt a lot more if I had the patience and mental tenacity to really understand what was going on.\n",

About 15 out of 100 marks were dedicated to a slightly tricky design question, similar to the problem sets. You really have to know the tiny details of the algorithms to get the harder questions correct. Thankfully, I got around the median score for these two, so it goes to show that the tutorials are way too difficult for the average student.\n",

It was unfortunate that due to my Coursemology grade, I incurred a B, which was a little disappointing given that the module did not seem to be bell curved. If it is possible, take this module in Semester 2 since Seth Gilbert will be making algorithms intuitive, and try to learn about applications of algorithms as they guide you. In Semester 1, it seems that you may get to do a lot more LeetCode style problems.\n",
